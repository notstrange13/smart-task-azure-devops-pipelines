# Smart Task Pipeline Examples

This directory contains real-world examples demonstrating both **decision** and **execution** modes of the Smart Task Azure DevOps extension. These examples are perfect for hackathon demonstrations and showcase the AI's ability to analyze, decide, and execute complex DevOps workflows.

## üéØ Example Categories

### Decision Mode Examples
These examples show how AI can analyze context and make intelligent decisions for your pipelines:

- **[decision-intelligent-testing.yml](./decision-intelligent-testing.yml)** - AI analyzes code changes and decides which tests to run
- **[decision-security-strategy.yml](./decision-security-strategy.yml)** - AI determines appropriate security scanning strategy based on project analysis

### Execution Mode Examples  
These examples demonstrate AI executing complex tasks and automations:

- **[execution-smart-deployment.yml](./execution-smart-deployment.yml)** - AI-driven deployment with environment detection and health checks
- **[execution-repository-automation.yml](./execution-repository-automation.yml)** - Automated repository maintenance and issue resolution

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
```yaml
# Set these as pipeline variables (keep AZURE_OPENAI_KEY as secret):
MODEL_TYPE: 'AZURE_OPENAI'                                    # Model provider type
AZURE_OPENAI_INSTANCE_NAME: 'your-azure-openai-instance'     # Your Azure OpenAI instance name
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY: '$(AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY)'                  # Secret variable for API key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: 'gpt-4o'                       # Your model deployment name
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION: '2024-02-15-preview'               # Azure OpenAI API version
```

### 2. Install the Extension
1. Install the Smart Task extension from Azure DevOps Marketplace
2. Configure your Azure OpenAI credentials
3. Copy any example pipeline to your repository
4. Customize the prompts for your specific use case

### 3. Run Your First Demo
```bash
# Use the hackathon demo for your first run:
cp examples/hackathon-demo.yml azure-pipelines.yml

# Commit and push to trigger the pipeline
git add azure-pipelines.yml
git commit -m "Add AI-powered pipeline demo"
git push
```

## üé≠ Demo Scenarios by Audience

### For **Developers**
Use `decision-intelligent-testing.yml`:
- "Look how AI analyzes our code changes and only runs the tests that matter"
- "No more waiting for full test suites on every feature branch"
- "The AI actually reads our package.json and understands our project structure"

### For **DevOps Engineers** 
Use `execution-smart-deployment.yml`:
- "AI handles complex deployment logic automatically"
- "Environment detection based on branch names and build context"
- "Automatic health checks and rollback procedures"

### For **Security Teams**
Use `decision-security-strategy.yml`:
- "Security scanning strategy adapts to what's actually in our code"
- "No more one-size-fits-all security pipelines"
- "Prioritizes security efforts based on actual risk assessment"

### For **Management/Business**
Use `hackathon-demo.yml`:
- "AI that actually understands our code and makes intelligent decisions"
- "Reduces pipeline time by 50-70% through smart test selection"
- "Self-optimizing DevOps that gets better over time"

## üîß Customization Guide

### Modifying Prompts
Each example contains detailed prompts that you can customize:

```yaml
prompt: |
  Your custom instructions here...
  
  1. **Analysis Phase:**
     - What specific analysis do you want?
     
  2. **Decision/Execution Phase:**
     - What decisions or actions should the AI take?
     
  3. **Output Requirements:**
     - What variables should be set?
